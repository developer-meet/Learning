    <h1>HTML Comments</h1>
    <p>
      HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document
      your HTML source code.

    <h2>HTML Comment Tag</h2>
    <p>
      You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- Write your comments here --&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the &lt;!-- and
      the --&gt; will be hidden from the display.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out
      HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.
    </p>

    <!-- Examples: -->

    <!-- This is a single line comment! -->

    <!-- 
      this is a 
      multi line 
      comment!
    -->
  </body>
</html>
