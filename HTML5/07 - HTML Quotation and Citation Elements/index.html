    <h1>HTML Quotation and Citation Elements</h1>
    <p>
      In this chapter we will go through the "blockquote","q", "abbr",
      "address", "cite", and "bdo" HTML elements.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML "blockquote" for Quotations</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML "blockquote" element defines a section that is quoted from
      another source.
    </p>
    <p>Browsers usually indent "blockquote" elements.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>

    <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www..org/who/index.html">
      For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the
      world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100
      countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to
      develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities,
      wildlife, and the places in which they live.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>

      Sint iste minus nostrum quod, iusto possimus! Aliquam suscipit atque,
      voluptatum quaerat exercitationem tenetur quas sit laborum sed, maxime
      reprehenderit.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>HTML "q" for Short Quotations</h2>
    <p>The HTML "q" tag defines a short quotation.</p>
    <p>Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>My goal is to: <q>Become a web Developer</q></p>

    <h2>HTML "abbr" for Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML "abbr" tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML",
      "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tip :</b> Use the global title attribute to show the description for
      the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in
      1948.
    </p>
    <p>I like <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Language.</p>

    <h2>HTML "address" for Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML "address" tag defines the contact information for the
      author/owner of a document or an article.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <address>
      Written by John Doe.<br />

    <h2>HTML "cite" for Work Title</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML "cite" tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a
      poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: </b> A person's name is not the title of a work.</p>
    <p>The text in the "cite" element usually renders in italic.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      The C language was created by Dennis Ritchie, as documented in
      <cite>The C Programming Language</cite>.
    </p>
