    <!-- JavaScript While Loop -->
    <h1>JavaScript While Loop</h1>
    <p>
      Some loops execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is
      true.
    </p>

    <h2>The While Loop</h2>
    <p>
      The <code class="highlight_text">while</code> loop loops through a block
      of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    </p>
    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
    <pre class="border-for-pre">
      while (condition) {
        // code block to be executed
      }</pre
    >
    <p>
      In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over
      again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10:
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p id="ex_while_loop"></p>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop
      will never end.
    </p>
    <p>This will crash your browser.</p>
    <script>
      let text = "";
      let i = 0;
      while (i < 10) {
        text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
        i++;
      }
      document.getElementById("ex_while_loop").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <!-- The Do While Loop -->
    <h2>The Do While Loop</h2>
    <p>
      The <code class="highlight_text">do while</code> loop is a variant of the
      while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if
      the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the
      condition is true.
    </p>
    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
    <pre class="border-for-pre">
      do {
        // code block to be executed
      }
      while (condition);</pre
    >
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
      The <code class="highlight_text">do while</code> runs at least once, even
      if the condition is false from the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:
    </p>
    <p>Example :</p>
    <p id="ex_do_while_loop"></p>
    <mark
      >Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise
      the loop will never end!
    </mark>
    <script>
      let numbers = "";
      let a = 0;

      do {
        numbers += "The number is " + a + " <br>";
        a++;
      } while (a <= 10);

      document.getElementById("ex_do_while_loop").innerHTML = numbers;
    </script>

    <!-- Comparing For and While -->
    <h2>Comparing For and While</h2>
    <p>
      A while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and
      statement 3 omitted.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      Uses a <code class="highlight_text">for</code> loop to collect the car
      names from the cars array:
    </p>
    <p id="ex_for_loop"></p>
    <p>
      Use a <code class="highlight_text">while</code> loop to collect the car
      names from the cars array:
    </p>
    <p id="another_ex_while_loop"></p>

    <script>
      let cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford", "TATA"];
      let allText = "";
      let b = 0;
      for (; cars[b]; ) {
        allText += cars[b] + "<br>";
        b++;
      }

      let carName = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford", "TATA"];
      let all_Text = "";
      let c = 0;
      while (carName[c]) {
        all_Text += carName[c] + "<br>";
        c++;
      }

      document.getElementById("ex_for_loop").innerHTML = allText;
      document.getElementById("another_ex_while_loop").innerHTML = all_Text;
    </script>
  </body>
